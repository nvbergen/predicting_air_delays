# predicting_air_delays
 Capstone project on predicing an airline delay from a point of origin. 
 
 ## Problem statement:
 Anyone who has traveled by air knows that delays can be frustrating and costly to the customer. 
 This project will attempt to predict a delay duration in an air travel itinerary and further attempt to ascribe a possible cost to that delay. 
 Hopefully, this will empower consumers with a bit more inforamtion if their trip will be 'smooth sailing' or a 'disaster' from a customer standpoint.
