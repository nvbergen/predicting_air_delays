    "#### Problem Statement: \n",
    "Both travelers and airlines find delays frustrating and costly. This project attempts to be able to predict the probability of a commercial flight delay for any flight in the United States. \n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "#### MVP:\n",
    "My product will be a small lightweight application run on `streamlit` platform for proof-of-concept where a user can find the probability of their desired flight having a delay, how long the delay may be, and how much will the delay cost the user in _lost time_ at the destination \n",

    "\n",
    "The primary challenge in this notebook is managing a large dataset. \n",
    "The next challenge will be to conduct meaningful EDA across the whole dataset. \n",
    "The notebook is structured as follows. \n",
    "1. Imports and set up\n",
    "2. The size and complexity issue. \n",
    "3. Cleaning steps. \n",
    "4. Feature engineering and selection. \n",
    "5. Save the final CSV and discuss next steps. \n",
